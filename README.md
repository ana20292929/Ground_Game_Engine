# "Ground" Game Engine and "Winter" Game

"Ground" is a simple 2D game engine that utilizes OpenGL and GLFW.

Winter is a very simple game made with "Ground".


## Features

I added a background to the game. The name being "Winter", I added a winter background.

The "hero" of the game is the snowman. He spawns on the left-hand side of the window. I implemented his movement. I specifically used the "A" and "D" keys for left and right (not the arrows) and made sure not to implement 
up and down since snowmen can't fly.
