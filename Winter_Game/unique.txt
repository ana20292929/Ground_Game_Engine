The "hero" of the game is the snowman. He spawns on the left hand side of window. I implemented his movement.
I specifically used the "A" and "D" keys for left and right (not the arrows), and made sure not to implement 
up and down since snowmen can't fly. To implement this feature, I created a function called OnUpdateCharacter 
within the Winter.cpp file. This function takes in a Ground::Unit object and checks the m_State of the 
character - depending on the key pressed. "A" means that m_State would be MOVE_LEFT, and so the function would 
change the x coordinates of the snowman by -15. "D" means that m_State would be MOVE_RIGHT, and so the function 
would change the x coordinates of the snowman by 15. If no key is pressed or if a key is released, the m_State 
would be NOT_MOVING, so the x coordinates of the snowman would be changed by 0.

Since the hero of the game is from the class Unit, I implemented a way for Unit objects to be drawn using the Renderer
class. Within the Renderer.h and Renderer.cpp, I created a new Draw function with a parameter of a Unit object 
instead of a Picture object. This function used the same implementation as the other Draw functions in Renderer.cpp,
except it took the picture and coordinate attributes from the Unit object.
